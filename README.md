# switch-hacks-rs
Switch memory read/write tool written in Rust. Communicates with your switch over USB, and assumes you have a USB sysbot installed.

There main tool/example is a simple Animal Crossing New Horizons inventory editor. I borrowed the item id list from the ACNHPoker tool since I couldn't be bothered to extract them from the game myself.
